    <h4>Steps to Shift from Retail Business to E-commerce: It’s Now or Never!

    <p><strong>Steps to Shift from Retail Business to E-commerce: It’s Now or Never!</strong></p>
    <p>The future of e-commerce is, now more than ever, BRIGHT! Though starting an online business is hard work and demands many steps and decisions that need to come together at the right time, helping others start an e-commerce business is something we have always loved doing.</p>
    <p>It’s taken us years to learn everything included in this page. But, we want you to be successful and to <em>ensure you a smooth ride for your ecommerce business</em><em>. </em></p>
    <p>Here are the&nbsp;steps for&nbsp;doing just that:</p>
    <p><strong>Step 1:&nbsp;Decide Which Online Channel/Platform to Use</strong></p>
    <p>There are a lot of e-commerce platforms out there. You first need to&nbsp;decide which e-commerce platform is&nbsp;right for&nbsp;you and best fits the needs of your business and your budget. If your business is transitioning to online for the FIRST time, simplicity in functionality both on the back end and customer-facing features will likely be paramount.</p>
    <h2><strong>Step 2: Build &amp; Design Your Website</strong></h2>
    <p>Most e-commerce platforms will offer users a variety of overlaid themes. You’ll be given some basic customization options, too. Look for themes and features that enable EASE of functionality, a simple, clean design, mobile usage, and simple checkout processes.</p>
    <p>You need to make sure that shoppers can easily finalize a purchase! A tedious checkout process can leave you with too many frustrated shoppers and abandoned carts and you certainly don’t want that.</p>
    <h3>Step 3: Determine Which Products You’ll Sell Online</h3>
    <p>Given the timeliness of your efforts to transition store functions to e-commerce, it’s important to prioritize WHICH products you’ll be selling online. You’ll want to ensure that your most profitable and/or in-demand products are available for purchase when you launch your website!</p>
    <h3>Step 4: Diversify Your Payment Methods</h3>
    <p>Consider which payment methods are MOST commonly used by your customers, and accommodate for the largest number of customers. Thankfully, most e-commerce providers offer integrations with the most common payment methods, such as Visa, Master Card, PayPal, Apple Pay, and more.</p>
    <h3>Step 5: Set Up Your Shipping &amp; Returns Functions</h3>
    <p>Once you’ve outlined your products and set up payment methods, the next step is to ensure you can get products to customers.</p>
    <p>Your e-commerce platform capabilities should include SHIPPING options, transparent shipping cost throughout the shopping experience, drop-shipping, printable shipping labels, and pre-setup shipping providers.</p>
    <p>FREE shipping is another important item to consider! Online shoppers are now largely expecting to receive free shipping options, so, if you can, offer it. If you can’t, then keep the shipping costs reasonable, or build the costs into your prices!!</p>
    <h2>Step 6: <strong>Start Promoting Your Store</strong></h2>
    <p>Once you’re up and running, it’s time to start your marketing! The hard part might be done, but you still need to get shoppers to your store. Some strategies that you can use to PROMOTE your online store are:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Start e-mail marketing campaigns to send out to new shoppers, lapsed customers, abandoned carts, and more.</li>
    <li>You probably already have Social Media accounts, so make sure to advertise your new store on all of these!</li>
    <li>Run a promotional campaign to highlight your grand opening or product line expansion. Remind shoppers that you’re here and ready to help!</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Those tips will get you started effectively moving online. And if you need help, we are here for you 24\7 to help you to start running a successful online business!</p>
